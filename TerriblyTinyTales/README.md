# TTT Assignment (https://6556970f0140ac13f6502b43--cerulean-griffin-dc095a.netlify.app/)

- This Repo contains the assignment given by @TerriblyTinyTales. Which does the following :
  1).Renders a "profile screen" as follows: [Profile](https://www.terriblytinytales.com/profile.jpeg) (this is a sample screenshot taken from mobile view)

  2).The profile data is hardcoded into this ![data.json](./src/assets/image.png) file and then fetched into Stories component.

  3).The screen when opened on different mobile types, is rendered consistently. This can be checked by changing device types in chrome's developer tools.

# Solution:

- I have made three components Stories, Navbar and Card in the same order.  
- The card component is where all the magic happens, i have passed the userdata from stories component to card component as props and rendered the user post data to the card component. as shown here : ![Alt text](./src/assets/image1.png) keeping in mind that if the length of the user description exceeds a particular amount , it replaces the user description with '...'

- The overall app looks like this in the mobile view : ![Alt text](./src/assets/image2.png)

-  I have hosted this site on [Netlify](https://6556970f0140ac13f6502b43--cerulean-griffin-dc095a.netlify.app/) and All details is here on the github readme.
